// Regression tests for gate:db-budget's two source scans in gates.mjs (#529, #702).
// Run: node --test scripts/gates.test.mjs   (CI: the gates.yml `static` job runs scripts/*.test.mjs
// directly — scripts/ is not a workspace package, so `pnpm test` never reaches these files)
//
// These plant real files in the checkout and run the real gate as a subprocess, deliberately: the
// defect class here lives in the SHELL PIPELINE, not the parse. A scan that strips the filename
// (`grep -h`) silently disarms every path-based filter downstream of it, and the bare numbers it
// emits still parse perfectly — so a test that stubs the grep and feeds the parse a fixture would
// stay green through exactly the bug it was written to catch. The planted file IS the input
// population: `git grep --untracked` reads the working tree, so a file on disk is a real input.
