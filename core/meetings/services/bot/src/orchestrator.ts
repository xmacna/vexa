/**
 * The meeting bot's lifecycle STATE MACHINE — the orchestrator core.

 * sinks (LifecycleSink, TranscriptSink) — no Playwright, no redis, no browser. So the
 * whole control flow is unit-testable offline (L2): inject fakes and assert the emitted
 * lifecycle.v1 sequence conforms to the schema + state machine.

 *           ─► subscribe acts ─► await end ─► leave ─► completed
 *
 * End signals while active: an acts.v1 `leave` (→ stopped), host removal (→ evicted), or a
 * timeout (→ left_alone / max_bot_time_exceeded). Any failure short-circuits to `failed`
 * with the right failure_stage + completion_reason. Every transition is guarded by
