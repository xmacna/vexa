/**
 * Typed join-failure evidence, produced AT THE SOURCE (#1059, #1058).
 *
 * The bot is the only party that ever sees the platform. It holds the DOM verdict, the message the
 * join layer threw, and the clock that tells a twenty-second refusal apart from a thirteen-minute
 * wait nobody answered. By the time the control plane reads the row, all of it is gone — which is how
 * 83 consecutive production join failures came to carry `reason: None`, and how a Teams refusal and
 * a Meet lobby expiry ended up sharing one label.
 *
 * So the classification happens HERE, on the evidence, and rides the terminal lifecycle.v1 event as
 * `join_evidence`. The control plane mirrors this taxonomy (`meeting_api/lifecycle/join_evidence.py`)
 * and re-derives a verdict when a producer sends none — the two implementations must stay in step,
 * and the shared vocabulary below is the contract between them.
 *
 * TWO AXES, deliberately independent:
 *   - `JoinFailureReason`      — WHAT happened.
 *   - `JoinFailureAttribution` — WHO it belongs to. This is what makes a reliability metric
 *     possible: a user who stopped their own bot and a host who never clicked admit are not
 *     software failures, and a rate that counts them is not a reliability rate.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN, absolutely. This module describes a run that has ALREADY ended. Every export is total —
 * it returns a verdict or `undefined` and never throws — and the orchestrator additionally guards
 * every call site. Evidence that cannot be produced must degrade to a less-informative terminal
 * event, NEVER to a changed join outcome.
 *
 * Rides lifecycle.v1 additively (the contract ingests liberally, `additionalProperties: true`) — the
 * same no-seal-bump path `infra_fault` and `stt_fault` already take. The sealed `CompletionReason`
 * enum is untouched: it drives retry policy, and this is a diagnostic axis, not a retry input.
 *
 * Run its tests: tsx src/join-evidence.test.ts
