 * Capture bridge (2b) — the browser-resident capture → pipeline pump + the speak path.

 * ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
 * ║ L4 (O6/VM): live-validated against a real meeting.                                      ║
 * ║ This whole file is BROWSER-RESIDENT glue: it injects page-side capture, bridges PCM     ║
 * ║ frames over the Playwright boundary, and drives the meeting-UI mic for speaking. None   ║
 * ║ of it can be proven by a unit test (no DOM, no MediaRecorder, no PulseAudio in CI) — it ║
 * ║ is code-complete + build-clean, and PROVEN only by the O6 VM run. The offline-provable  ║
 * ║ engine it pumps into is pipeline.ts (L2/L3).                                            ║
 * ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
 *
 * Ported faithfully from the working production bot
 *   services/vexa-bot/core/src/index.ts:
 *     • launch (authenticated, persistent context + S3 restore)  → index.ts:2313–2347
 *     • the per-speaker bridge binding + page-side capture wiring → index.ts:1930, 1947–1957
 *     • the Node-side frame callback shape (speakerIndex, number[]) → index.ts:1598–1605
 *     • the speak path (Redis act → meeting-UI mic unmute → PulseAudio tts_sink) → index.ts:595, 1039–1059
 *
 * Isolation note: the page-side capture module (@vexa/gmeet-capture / @vexa/capture-codec) is
 * NOT a bot dependency (gate:isolation) — it is a BROWSER bundle loaded into the page at runtime
 * (production's `window.VexaBrowserUtils`, installed via addInitScript of the prebuilt
 * browser-utils.global.js). The Node side here imports nothing from those packages; PCM frames
 * cross as plain `(speakerIndex: number, samples: number[])` over `page.exposeFunction`, exactly
 * as production does, so the bot's import surface stays within the gate.
