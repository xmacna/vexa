"""L1 — typed join-failure evidence, from classification through to the persisted row (#1059, #1058).

The production defect this file exists to make impossible again: 83 consecutive hosted
``join_failure`` meetings, every one of them carrying ``data.reason = None``, and every one of them
labelled identically whether the platform refused the bot in twenty seconds or nobody answered the
door for thirteen minutes. The system knew; the row did not.

What is proved here, offline (no docker, no DB, no network — TestClient + the in-memory repo):

  1. **Classification.** The Python taxonomy derives the right typed reason from the signals a
     producer actually holds — including the #1058 split, made from the timing signature alone.
  2. **Attribution.** Every typed reason maps to the owner the reliability gate reads, and the two
     evidence-driven overrides fire. This is what makes
     ``system_failure_rate = failures(system_fault) / fair-chance meetings`` computable.
  3. **Persistence.** A terminal callback lands ``data.reason`` AND ``data.join_evidence`` on the
     meeting row — the exact query (``data->>'reason'``) that returned NULL 83 times now answers.
  4. **Surfacing.** The evidence survives the list-view projection (which drops the heavy forensics
     keys) so it is aggregatable from ``GET /meetings``, not just from a single detail fetch.
  5. **Replayable fixtures.** One recorded terminal per failure class, replayed through the shipped
     HTTP callback, deterministically classified.
  6. **Reconcile-driven terminals.** The sweep's OWN failures — the ones the issue traced to a
     branch that set no reason at all — carry evidence too, tagged as second-hand.
  7. **Fail-open.** A hostile or malformed evidence payload degrades the report and nothing else;
     the FSM advance, the terminal status, and the callback's 200 are untouched.
  8. **Cross-language parity.** The bot's TypeScript vocabulary and this one are the same words.

This module owns its own fixtures deliberately (``conftest.py`` is left alone).
