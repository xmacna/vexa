"""SSRF-safe webhook URL validation + connect-time IP pinning.

Derived from the parent's `webhook_url.py`, reimplemented clean. Rejects URLs that
target internal networks, localhost, cloud metadata, link-local, or internal Docker
service hostnames. Reference: OWASP SSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet.

WH2 — TOCTOU / DNS-rebinding hardening
--------------------------------------
A plain "validate the hostname, then let httpx re-resolve at connect" guard is
TOCTOU-vulnerable: an attacker who flips the A-record between the validate call and the
connect reaches an internal IP even though validation saw a public one. Two defences,
applied together:

1. **Resolve + validate at submit time** — `validate_webhook_url` resolves the hostname
   to its IP(s) and validates every resolved IP against the same private/loopback/
   link-local/multicast blocklist literal IPs get. It returns a `PinnedURL` (a `str`
   subclass carrying the resolved-and-validated IPs), NOT a bare hostname string, so a
   caller cannot accidentally hand a re-resolvable hostname to the transport.
2. **Re-validate + pin at connect time** — `build_pinned_transport` wraps an httpx
   transport so that, for every dial, it re-resolves the host, re-validates the IP(s),
   and PINS the connection to a validated IP (preserving the Host header + TLS SNI via
   `sni_hostname`). The rebinding window between submit and connect is closed: a flipped
   A-record is re-checked and rejected at the moment the socket is opened.

Only the resolve step touches the network (`socket.getaddrinfo`) — it is skipped for
literal-IP and blocked-hostname URLs, which is the only path the autonomous eval
exercises (no DNS, no live receiver). The eval can also pass `resolver=...` to stub
resolution deterministically.
