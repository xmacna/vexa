"""``create_app(...) -> FastAPI`` — the ONE uvicorn-able meeting-api modular monolith (P2).

This is the unified meeting-api: ONE FastAPI app composed of front-doored modules, each a
sub-package of ``meeting_api`` mounted here (the v0.12 analog of the parent ``main.py``'s flat
``app.include_router(...)`` list, but each module is an isolated brick behind a port-seam):

  * **lifecycle** — the bot lifecycle callback receiver + meeting-state FSM (lifecycle.v1):
    POST ``/bots/internal/callback/lifecycle``.
  * **bot_spawn** — POST ``/bots``: build the invocation.v1 invocation + mint the MeetingToken +
    spawn the meeting-bot over runtime.v1, eager-creating the MeetingSession on spawn.
  * **collector** — the folded-in transcript backend (collector domain):
    GET ``/transcripts/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}``, GET ``/meetings``,
    POST ``/ws/authorize-subscribe`` (+ the ``transcription_segments`` → ``tc:…:mutable`` consumer).
  * **recordings** — POST ``/internal/recordings/upload``, GET ``/recordings``,
    GET ``/recordings/{id}/master`` (chunks + master → ``meeting.data`` JSONB).
  * **obs** — ``TraceMiddleware`` (logevent.v1 trace_id threading) + the shared ``GET /health``.

webhooks + scheduling are library bricks (no HTTP surface of their own in the core path — they are
driven by the lifecycle/bot_spawn flows); they are re-exported from the package front door and wired
by the production composition root in P3. continue_meeting / max-bots / join-retry / the segment
consumer loop are P3 seams.

``create_app`` takes every collaborator as an injected port (or builds a default in-memory stack for
the app factory / tests), so the SAME app runs with real adapters in prod and in-process fakes in
the conformance harness — the conformance assertions therefore drive THIS shipped app.

        ALSO consumes a runtime-confirmed TERMINAL workload state as evidence the run is over, driving a
        synthetic terminal through the SAME in-process lifecycle logic (no HTTP self-POST):

          * PRE-ACTIVE meeting → ``failed`` (CC5): the bot never started/reported and never will, so the
            meeting would otherwise hang ``requested``/``joining`` forever.
          * WAS-ACTIVE meeting (``stopping``/``active``/``needs_help``) → ``completed``: the bot reached
            the meeting but its workload is now runtime-confirmed gone WITHOUT its own terminal callback
            (e.g. SIGKILLed at teardown before it could POST ``completed``, or killed in the waiting room
            on a stop). Without this the meeting stays ``stopping`` and the stop-reconcile sweep re-DELETEs
            (now 404) every 15s FOREVER — the reaper loop. The confirmed destroy IS the terminal evidence
            (#50's principle: real evidence, not a bare 404) → complete it and stop the loop.

        THE FIX (live 409): the synthetic terminal is applied by calling the in-process lifecycle entry
        (``app.state.apply_lifecycle_event``) DIRECTLY with ``transition_source=RUNTIME_DESTROY`` and
        ``force_terminal_on_destroy=True`` — NOT an httpx POST to ``127.0.0.1:PORT``. The old self-POST
        409'd whenever the in-process FSM record was a stale non-terminal state the DB had already moved
        past (e.g. store still ``joining`` while the DB user-stop set ``stopping`` — ``joining →
        completed`` is illegal for a bot-driven edge). The direct in-process call advances the SAME FSM
        instance, and the runtime-destroy source forces the terminal edge on real teardown evidence, so
        the meeting reaches terminal, the reaper stops, and the copilot ``session_end`` reap fires."""
