"""The meeting-state machine + the LifecycleSink port.

Derived from real parent behavior (`services/meeting-api/meeting_api/schemas.py`
`get_valid_status_transitions` + `callbacks.py`), reimplemented clean for the bot's
DOMAIN lifecycle (lifecycle.v1's `BotStatus`), not the server-side meeting status
(which also has `requested`/`stopping`).

The lifecycle.v1 README documents the machine; this is the machine-checked
`can_transition`. The sink is the receiver: it validates each event at the seam
(the caller does jsonschema-by-path against the sealed schema) and advances the FSM,
rejecting illegal transitions and recording terminal attribution.
