"""Typed join-failure evidence — the WHY behind a `failed` pre-active meeting (#1059, #1058).

Two production defects motivate this module, and they are the same defect seen from two sides:

  * **#1059 — the record is empty.** Every one of 83 hosted `join_failure` meetings carried
    ``data.reason = None``. Not because nobody knew: the bot stamps a human ``reason`` on every
    terminal it emits (``orchestrator.ts``), the reconcile sweep stamps the probe's own answer
    (``reconcile.py``), and the FSM stores it on ``MeetingRecord.reason``. It simply never reached
    the JSONB — ``MeetingRecord.data`` projected the reason ONLY into ``last_error.reason``, a key
    the list view drops (``projection.LIST_OMIT_KEYS``) and no aggregate query looks at. Diagnosis
    stopped at the shape of the failure.
  * **#1058 — the label conflates.** A ~20s Teams death (the platform refused us before a lobby
    ever rendered) and a ~13min Google Meet death (a bot that sat in the waiting room until its
    budget expired) both land as ``completion_reason = join_failure``. Same label, different owner,
    different fix, and any SLO built on it measures two unrelated things.

The fix for both is TWO axes this module owns, carried alongside — never instead of — the sealed
lifecycle.v1 ``CompletionReason`` (which stays untouched: it is the retry classifier's input, see
``retry.py``):

  * :class:`JoinFailureReason` — WHAT happened, derived from the signals we actually hold. This is
    the diagnostic axis #1058 calls missing.
  * :class:`JoinFailureAttribution` — WHO it belongs to: ``system_fault`` / ``user_action`` /
    ``host_action`` / ``exogenous_platform`` / ``unknown``. This is the axis the reliability gate
    reads, and the reason the raw failed-status rate is not a reliability metric: it counts a user
    who stopped their own bot and a host who never clicked admit as if the software had failed.
    With attribution persisted, the gate metric becomes a query::

        system_failure_rate = failures(attribution = system_fault) / fair-chance meetings

    per release and per platform. The two axes are genuinely independent — the SAME typed
    ``admission_timeout`` is a host's choice normally, and ours the moment the evidence shows our
    admission flow is what broke.

**ATTRIBUTE, never manufacture.** Every value below is reachable from evidence the system already
holds: which stage the bot died in, whether it ever reported reaching the lobby, how long it spent
there against the budget the control plane itself issued, and the platform's own message. When the
signals do not support a verdict the answer is :attr:`JoinFailureReason.UNKNOWN` with the raw detail
preserved — an honest "we don't know" beats a plausible label nobody can trust.

**FAIL-OPEN.** Nothing here may change join behaviour. Every public entry point is total: it
returns a best-effort answer or ``None`` and never raises, so a malformed payload, a missing timing
or an unknown enum degrades the evidence and nothing else. Callers still wrap it (belt and braces) —
capturing evidence must never be able to fail a meeting that would otherwise have succeeded.

The bot has a mirror of this taxonomy (``services/bot/src/join-evidence.ts``) so it can classify at
the source, where the platform signal and the stage timings actually live; this module accepts that
verdict when it is present and DERIVES one when it is not (a reconcile-driven terminal, a
runtime-confirmed destroy, or a bot too old to send one). Either way the row gets evidence.

    Deliberately small and extensible: each value names a distinct OWNER and a distinct FIX, which
    is the whole point of splitting them. Add a value only when it would be acted on differently.

    * :attr:`PLATFORM_REJECTION` — the platform/host actively DENIED us. A moderator clicked deny, or
      the client refused the automated join outright (the sealed ``awaiting_admission_rejected``
      path, a Zoom RTMS block, a bot-detection block). Deterministic and fast; a re-spawn hits the
      same wall. Owner: the account/meeting policy, not us.
    * :attr:`ADMISSION_TIMEOUT` — nobody ever answered. The bot reached the waiting room and sat
      there until the lobby budget the control plane issued (``bot_spawn.service.LOBBY_BUDGET_MS``)
      ran out. This is the ~13min Google Meet population of #1058: a REAPING, not a refusal. Owner:
      the meeting host (or our budget), not the join code.
    * :attr:`AUTH_SESSION_MISSING` — authenticated mode found a signed-out browser profile. The
      profile is dead; no re-spawn can fix it. Owner: session provisioning.
    * :attr:`NEVER_REACHED_LOBBY` — the meeting page loaded but no admission signal ever appeared:
      no lobby, no leave button, nothing the join layer recognises. This is the selector-rot /
      platform-UI-change class (#806) and the shape a fast Teams refusal takes when it renders no
      lobby at all. Owner: the join layer.
    * :attr:`NAVIGATION_FAILURE` — the bot never got as far as the meeting page: a navigation error,
      a redirect off the meeting origin (the Teams sign-in redirect), a closed target, an
      unsupported platform. Owner: infra / URL construction.
    * :attr:`STOPPED_BEFORE_ADMISSION` — the USER ended the run while the bot was still knocking (the
      orchestrator's withdraw branch; the sealed reason is ``stopped``). It lands with status
      ``failed`` because the bot never became active, and it is emphatically NOT a failure of ours —
      counting it as one is exactly what makes a raw failed-status rate meaningless.
    * :attr:`UNKNOWN` — the signals do not support any of the above. ``detail`` carries whatever the
      producer did observe. Never a synonym for "probably X".

    but the SAME typed reason is ours the moment the evidence shows our admission flow was the thing
    that broke. Collapsing the two axes is what made the raw failed-status rate uninterpretable —
    it counts user stops and host non-admissions as if the software had failed.

    The gate metric this exists to make computable::

        system_failure_rate = failures(attribution = system_fault) / fair-chance meetings

    per release and per platform, where a *fair-chance* meeting is one the system was actually given
    the opportunity to serve (excludes `user_action`: a run the user ended before admission was
    never ours to win).

    * :attr:`SYSTEM_FAULT` — WE failed to do our job: the join flow broke, navigation never landed,
      the authenticated session was lost, the bot crashed, the admission flow itself wedged. The
      numerator of the gate metric, and the only bucket a fix of ours can move.
    * :attr:`USER_ACTION` — the user ended the run themselves (a stop while the bot was still
      knocking). Not a failure in any sense that matters; excluded from the denominator entirely.
    * :attr:`HOST_ACTION` — the meeting's host/moderator decided: denied the bot, or never answered
      the knock. A funnel outcome, not a defect. Moves with customer behaviour, not with our code.
    * :attr:`EXOGENOUS_PLATFORM` — the platform itself refused or changed under us in a way we can
      POSITIVELY identify (an automated-join policy block, an identified client-side change). Real,
      actionable, and ours to absorb — but not a regression of our own making, which is exactly the
      endogenous/exogenous split a release gate must not blur.
    * :attr:`UNKNOWN` — the evidence does not support an owner. Counted separately and never quietly
      folded into `system_fault` (which would inflate the gate metric with our own ignorance) nor
      into `host_action` (which would hide real defects).
