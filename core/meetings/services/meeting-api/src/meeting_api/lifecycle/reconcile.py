"""Stop-reconcile sweep — the backstop that GUARANTEES teardown (ADR-0024 / CC6).

A user stop publishes a fire-and-forget ``leave`` over redis pub/sub. A BOOTING bot that hasn't
subscribed is handled directly by the stop route (``stop_router`` B1). But an ACTIVE bot that simply
MISSED the leave (a redis blip, a wedged consumer) would stay live forever — the DB says ``stopping``,
a real bot is in the meeting: an orphan. This sweep is the backstop:

  for each meeting stuck ``stopping`` past the grace window →
    1. **kill the workload** (``runtime.delete_workload``) so the orphan bot is actually gone (CC6) —
       a stop must GUARANTEE the effect, not merely request it (ADR-0024) — and require the kernel to
       CONFIRM it. Then, and only then,
    2. complete it through the bot's OWN lifecycle callback (so the FSM, webhook, and ws frame all fire
       identically — no duplicate logic).

Teardown-BEFORE-complete, and evidence-gated (the orphaned-live-bot fix): a runtime 404
(``WorkloadUnknown``) means the kernel does not know the workload — NOT that the container is gone
(a recreated runtime forgets live bots). On an unconfirmed teardown the meeting is NOT completed:
it stays ``stopping`` (truthful — the stop is not done), the failure is logged LOUD, and the next
sweep retries (the re-adopting runtime answers truthfully once it has booted).

Pure + injectable: ``post_lifecycle`` is the callback poster (prod = httpx to this process's own
``/bots/internal/callback/lifecycle``; tests = an in-memory recorder), ``runtime`` is the RuntimeClient
port (prod = HttpRuntimeClient; tests = FakeRuntimeClient). Best-effort per meeting — never raises.

    (``drive_terminal`` — POST-to-self in prod) so the FSM → persist → webhook → ws path fires identically.

    This is the evidence-based principle of #50, applied to the OTHER terminal source. #50 requires
    real evidence before completing a meeting; a runtime ``destroyed`` for a workload the kernel just tore
    down IS that evidence (not a bare 404 / amnesia — the runtime is affirmatively reporting the workload
    gone). Two cases by the meeting's current stage:

      * PRE-ACTIVE (``requested``/``joining``/``awaiting_admission``) — the bot never reported ``active`` and
        never will (image-pull fail, OOM, crash on boot, or a stop that killed it in the waiting room
        before it sent its own terminal callback) → synthetic ``failed`` attributed to the stage it died in
        (CC5).
      * WAS-ACTIVE (``stopping``/``active``/``needs_help``) — the bot reached the meeting, but its workload
        is now confirmed gone WITHOUT its own terminal callback having landed (e.g. it was SIGKILLed at
        teardown before it could POST ``completed``). This is exactly the reaper-loop incident: DELETE
        ``/workloads/{id}`` → 200, runtime posts ``state=destroyed``, but the meeting stayed ``stopping``
        and the stop-reconcile sweep re-DELETEs (now 404) every 15s forever. The confirmed destroy is
        terminal evidence → complete the meeting (it WAS active, so ``completed``), stopping the loop.

    Returns True iff a synthetic terminal was driven. No-op (False) when the state isn't terminal, the
    workload is unknown, or the meeting already reached a terminal status (the bot's own callback already
    landed — a redelivered terminal is an idempotent 200 no-op at the callback anyway). Best-effort:
