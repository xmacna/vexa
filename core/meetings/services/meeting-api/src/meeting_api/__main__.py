"""``python -m meeting_api`` — the production meeting-api (P4 compose CMD).

Assembles the unified modular-monolith (``meeting_api.create_app``) with the REAL per-module
adapters (SQLAlchemy + redis + MinIO/S3 + httpx-runtime), then — per P4 — ALSO starts the
control-plane background loops alongside the HTTP app via the FastAPI lifespan:

  * **collector segment consumer** — drains the ``transcription_segments`` redis stream
    (``consume_segments`` → ``ingest`` → publish ``tc:…:mutable``) on a poll interval.
  * **db-writer** — the RESTORED parent flush loop (0.10 ``process_redis_to_postgres``): each tick
    moves immutable live segments from the redis hash ``meeting:{id}:segments`` into the
    ``transcriptions`` table (upsert on segment identity; redis trimmed only after the confirmed
    write) and drains the copilot's ``proc:meeting:{id}`` notes into ``meeting.data`` JSONB.
  * **webhook retry-drain** — one ``drain_retry_queue`` sweep per interval over the redis retry
    queue (failed ``meeting.status_change`` deliveries are retried with backoff).

Each loop is a single-tick function the eval drives explicitly; here the entrypoint wraps it in the
``while True: tick; sleep`` poll the deployment uses. uvicorn-target: ``uvicorn meeting_api.__main__:app``.

#637 — at ``meetingApi.replicaCount>1`` every replica starts these same loops, so each live tick body
is wrapped in a per-loop Postgres advisory lock (``sweeps.single_flight``): the real work runs once per
interval, not once per replica. ``segment-consumer`` is intentionally left unguarded (Redis competing
consumer). The former ``scheduler-tick`` loop was dead code (``app.state.scheduler`` was never wired —
the ``Scheduler`` in ``scheduling/`` is an eval-only engine) and has been removed.
