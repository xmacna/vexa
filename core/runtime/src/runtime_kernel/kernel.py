"""The runtime kernel — orchestrates a workload through the runtime.v1 lifecycle over a Backend,
emitting RuntimeEvents on every transition. `profile` is opaque (P11): the kernel maps it to a
runnable via a registry (policy/config), but the contract never sees the command.

Persistence is via the WorkloadStore port: the (spec, status) pair lives in the store (InMemory by
default, Redis for durability) so the runtime survives a restart. Live backend handles are NOT
serializable, so they live in a process-local map keyed by workloadId; on a fresh process they are
simply absent, and the reloaded statuses describe what was running before the restart.

Quotas (O-RT-2): create() rejects the N+1th active workload for an owner via the store's
count_for_owner."""
