"""#718 C1 — a workload that is DEAD AT START must not read as spawned.

The docker backend raises loudly when the image is absent (``docker create … (404): No such
image``). The kernel records the honest ``stopped``/``start_failed`` state (so ``GET /workloads``
and the callback stream stay truthful) but must NOT answer the create as success: the kernel
raises ``StartFailed`` and the HTTP API maps it to a 502 that NAMES the cause, logging
``workload_spawn_failed`` instead of ``workload_spawned``.

Negative control (the bug this fixes): before the fix, ``create()`` caught the start failure and
RETURNED the stopped status, so ``POST /workloads`` answered 201 + ``workload_spawned`` over a
workload that never came up.
